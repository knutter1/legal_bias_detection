Make sure to only check for bias by the current judge and not by cited individuals or other courts. \n\nUse the definitions and criteria listed below:\n\n\n1. Gender Bias\nGender bias refers to the systematic unequal treatment of individuals based on gender.\n\nCharacteristics:\n- Structural bias: Use of grammatical constructions that reinforce stereotypical assumptions.\n- Contextual bias: Use of specific words or tone that reinforce gender-related roles or stereotypes.\n\nStereotyping: Attributing traits or occupations based on socially constructed gender roles.\nIdentify gender bias by:\n- Analyzing word associations (e.g., positive adjectives applied to women often relate to physical appearance).\n- Reviewing occupational terms for gender stereotypes.\n- Examining grammatical structures for gender-based generalizations.\n\n\n2. Religious Bias\nReligious bias refers to implicit attitudes and prejudices that often operate below conscious awareness and can hinder interfaith cooperation.\n\nCharacteristics:\n- Rooted in social-psychological differences like status, scriptures, or transnational influences.\n- Group favoritism: the in-group is portrayed positively, the out-group negatively.\n- Divergent adherence to religious texts can amplify perceived theological differences.\n\nIdentify this bias by:\n- Investigating implicit prejudices.\n- Analyzing differing reactions to interfaith messages depending on content and source.\n- Measuring delays in associating positive/negative attributes with specific religious groups.\n\n\n3. Racial Bias\nRacial bias can be either implicit (largely unconscious) or explicit (conscious). Both are widespread and have serious negative effects.\n\nCharacteristics:\n- Reinforced by categorization, stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination.\n- Can result in distorted judgments and discriminatory behavior, even without intent.\n\nIdentify this bias by:\n- Presence of stereotypes in social or professional contexts.\n- Skewed judgments or behaviors under uncertainty or time pressure.\n- Differential treatment based on group characteristics.\n\n\n4. Sexual Orientation Bias\nSexual orientation bias involves the conscious or unconscious disadvantage of individuals based on their sexual preference, especially in the workplace, education, or other social contexts.\n\nCharacteristics:\n- Discrimination based on stereotypes or prejudice against sexual minorities.\n- Unequal treatment in employment, promotion, or other work-related decisions.\n- Denial of equal rights or access to services.\n\nIdentify this bias by:\n- Comparing treatment of homosexual and heterosexual individuals in similar contexts.\n- Analyzing language or actions that reflect explicit or implicit prejudice.\n- Detecting disproportionate application of rules that disadvantage certain groups.\n\n\n5.

COLLINS, SECRETARY OF\nVETERANS AFFAIRS certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the federal circuit No. 23–713. Argued October 16, 2024—Decided\nMarch 5, 2025 The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)\napplies a “benefit-of-the-doubt rule” that tips the scales in a\nveteran’s favor when evidence regarding any issue material to a\nservice-related disability claim is in “approximate balance.” 38\nU. S. C. §5107(b) . Petitioners are veterans who\napplied for service-connected post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)\ndisability benefits and were dissatisfied with the VA’s resolution\nof their claims. Petitioner Joshua Bufkin claimed that his PTSD\nstemmed from his military service, but the VA found no clear link.\nPetitioner Norman Thornton obtained service-connected PTSD\ndisability benefits, but the VA denied his most recent request to\nincrease his disability rating. These adverse determinations were\nreviewed de novo by the Board of Veterans’ Appeals,\nwhich rendered final decisions on behalf of the VA denying the\nclaims. Petitioners then challenged the adverse determinations\nbefore the U. S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims\n(Veterans Court). Under §7261(a), the Veterans Court reviews legal\nissues de novo and factual issues for clear error. And under\n§7261(b)(1), the Veterans Court must “take due account” of the VA’s\napplication of the benefit-of-the-doubt rule. Applying those\nstandards, the Veterans Court affirmed the VA’s adverse benefit\ndeterminations, finding that the Board’s approximate-balance\ndeterminations were not clearly erroneous. The petitioners then\nappealed to the Federal Circuit, challenging the Veterans Court’s\nlegal interpretation of §7261(b)(1), and arguing that the statutory\ncommand to “take due account” of the VA’s application of the\nbenefit-of-the-doubt rule requires the Veterans Court to review the\nentire record de novo and decide for itself whether the\nevidence is in approximate balance. The Federal Circuit rejected\nthis argument and affirmed. Held : The VA’s determination that\nthe evidence regarding a service-related disability claim is in\n“approximate balance” is a predominantly factual determination\nreviewed only for clear error. Pp. 8–17. (a) Under §7261(b)(1)’s plain text, the\nVeterans Court must “take due account” of the VA’s application of\nthe benefit-of-the-doubt rule. This requirement directs the\nVeterans Court to give appropriate attention to the VA’s work. The\nVeterans Court must review the VA’s application of the\nbenefit-of-the-doubt rule “[i]n making the determinations under\nsubsection (a).” §7261(b)(1). Accordingly, the standards of review\nprovided in subsection (a) also govern the Veterans Court’s review\nof benefit-of-the-doubt issues. Section 7261(b)(1) makes explicit\nthe Veterans Court’s previously implicit duty to review the VA’s\napplication of the benefit-of-the-doubt rule, pursuant to the\nstandards set forth in subsection (a). Pp. 8–10. (b) The appropriate standard of review\nfor any given challenge depends on whether the challenge is factual\nor legal in nature. The parties contest whether a veteran’s\nchallenge to the VA’s determination that the evidence on a\nparticular material issue is not in approximate balance involves a\nlegal inquiry subject to de novo review, or a factual\nfinding, or at least a predominantly factual, mixed question of law\nand fact, subject to clear-error review. The approximate-balance determination involves\ntwo steps. First, the VA reviews each item of evidence and assigns\nweight to it—a factfinding inquiry reviewed only for clear error.\nSecond, the VA determines whether the evidence is in approximate\nbalance. See §5107(b). This second step includes both legal and\nfactual components: factual because it involves marshaling and\nweighing evidence, and legal because the “approximate balance”\ndetermination involves whether the evidence satisfies a legal\nstandard. The VA’s approximate-balance determination is thus at\nmost a mixed question. And the appropriate standard of review for a\nmixed question depends “on whether answering it entails primarily\nlegal or factual work.” U. S. Bank N. A. v. Village at Lakeridge, LLC , 583 U.S. 387, 396. Reviewing a determination whether record\nevidence is approximately balanced is “about as factual sounding”\nas any question gets. Id. , at 397. In Bufkin’s case, the\nBoard weighed medical opinions and family testimony to assess his\nPTSD claims. Similarly, the Board in Thornton’s case analyzed\nsymptom severity and medical evidence to assess his disability\nrating. Both cases demonstrate that approximate-balance\ndeterminations require case-specific factual review warranting\nclear-error review. Pp. 10–13. (c) Petitioners’ counterarguments are\nunpersuasive. First, petitioners urge that by amending §7261(b)(1)\nto include the modest phrase, “take due account,” Congress imposed\na new standard of review for challenges to the VA’s application of\nthe benefit-of the-doubt rule. But had Congress intended to do so,\nit would have identified a standard, just as it did in §7261(a).\nPetitioners next argue that, even if §7261(b)(1) incorporates\n§7261(a)’s standards of review, the VA’s approximate-balance\ndetermination is much like a court’s probable-cause determination,\nwhich involves a mixed-question inquiry that appellate courts\nreview de novo . Ornelas v. United States , 517 U.S.\n690 , 699. Two features distinguish the probable-cause\ndetermination from the VA’s determination here. First, probable\ncause is a constitutional standard, creating a strong presumption\nthat determinations under that standard are subject to de\nnovo review. By contrast, the approximate-balance determination\nis a creature of statute, not the Constitution. Second, probable\ncause poses a question that requires substantial “legal work,” U. S. Bank, 583 U. S., at 398, but the VA’s\napproximate-balance determination lacks a comparable legal\ncomponent. Petitioners contend that the Federal Circuit’s\nreading of §7261(b)(1) renders the provision superfluous. While\nthis Court’s reading of §7261(b)(1) might involve some redundancy,\nthe canon against surplusage does not apply here because\npetitioners have not identified a competing interpretation that\nwould avoid redundancy. See Marx v. General Revenue\nCorp. , 568 U.S.\n371 , 385. Pp. 13–17. 75 F. 4th 1368, affirmed. Thomas, J., delivered the opinion of the\nCourt, in which Roberts, C. J., and Alito, Sotomayor, Kagan,\nKavanaugh, and Barrett, JJ., joined. Jackson, J., filed a\ndissenting opinion, in which Gorsuch, J., joined.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 23–713 _________________ JOSHUA E. BUFKIN, PETITIONER v. DOUGLAS\nA. COLLINS, SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS NORMAN F. THORNTON, PETITIONER v. DOUGLAS A. COLLINS, SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the federal circuit [March 5, 2025] Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the\nCourt. When evaluating a veteran’s claim for\nservice-related disability benefits, the Department of Veterans\nAffairs (VA) applies a unique standard of proof known as the\n“benefit-of-the-doubt rule.” This rule requires the VA to “give the\nbenefit of the doubt to the claimant” whenever “there is an\napproximate balance of positive and negative evidence” on any issue\nmaterial to the claim. 38 U. S. C. §5107(b). When\nreviewing the VA’s benefits decisions, the United States Court of\nAppeals for Veterans Claims (Veterans Court) must “take due\naccount” of the VA’s application of the benefit-of-the-doubt rule.\n§7261(b)(1). The question before us is what the Veterans Court must\ndo to comply with that statutory command. We hold that the Veterans\nCourt must review the VA’s application of the rule the same way it\nwould any other determination—by reviewing legal issues de\nnovo and factual issues for clear error. See §7261(a). And, we\nhold that the VA’s determination that the evidence is in\napproximate balance is a predominantly factual determination\nreviewed only for clear error. I A Congress provides veterans a wide range of\nbenefits, including compensation for disabilities caused or\naggravated by active-duty military service. §§1110, 1131. The VA,\nled by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, administers the laws that\nprovide for those benefits. §§301, 303. Veterans who suffer from service-connected post-\ntraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are among those entitled to\ndisability benefits. To establish service-connected PTSD, the VA\nrequires medical evidence diagnosing the condition and linking the\nveteran’s symptoms with an “in-service stressor,” as well as\ncredible evidence that the in-service stressor occurred. 38 CFR\n§3.304(f ) (2023). When the VA finds those conditions\nsatisfied, it assigns a disability rating that reflects reductions\nin earning capacity. 38 U. S. C. §1155; 38 CFR §4.130.\nThis rating determines the amount of compensation a veteran\nreceives. A veteran begins the claims process by\nsubmitting a request for benefits to the VA. A VA regional office\nthen adjudicates the claim. If the regional office issues an\nadverse decision, the veteran may seek de novo review from\nthe Board of Veterans’ Appeals. The Board is an administrative body\nwithin the VA that renders final decisions for the agency. 38\nU. S. C. §§7101, 7104(a). Congress designed the VA’s adjudicatory process\nto function “ ‘with a high degree of informality and\nsolicitude for the claimant.’ ” Henderson v. Shinseki , 562 U.S.\n428 , 431 (2011) (quoting Walters v. National Assn. of\nRadiation Survivors , 473 U.S.\n305 , 311 (1985)). For example, Congress imposes no statute of\nlimitations on a veteran’s claim for benefits. The process at both\nthe regional offices and the Board is ex parte and\nnonadversarial. 38 CFR §§3.103(a), 20.700(c). And, the VA must\nassist veterans in developing the evidence necessary to\nsubstantiate their claims. 38\nU. S. C. §5103A(a)(1). Congress also requires the regional offices and\nthe Board to give veterans the benefit of the doubt on close\nissues. Specifically, the VA must “consider all information and lay\nand medical evidence of record,” and, “[w]hen there is an\napproximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any\nissue material to the determination of a matter, the [VA] shall\ngive the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.” §5107(b). This rule\nreflects a pro-veteran policy choice that dates back to the\npost-Civil War era. See 50 Fed. Reg. 34454 (1985). A veteran who receives an adverse decision from\nthe Board may appeal to the Veterans Court, an Article I tribunal.\nThe Veterans Court has exclusive jurisdiction to review final\ndecisions of the Board. §7252(a). Section 7261 defines the scope of the Veterans\nCourt’s review. Subsection (a), which sets forth the court’s\nadjudicatory powers, is modeled after the scope-of-review provision\nin the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). See 5 U. S. C.\n§706. It empowers the Veterans Court to decide relevant questions\nof law; to compel action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably\ndelayed; and to hold unlawful and set aside VA findings,\nconclusions, rules, and regulations that are arbitrary, capricious,\nan abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law. 38\nU. S. C. §§7261(a)(1)–(3). Unlike the APA, however,\n§7261(a) imposes a slightly different standard of review for\nfactual findings. The Veterans Court may set aside or reverse a\nfactual finding only if “the finding is clearly erroneous,” in\ncontrast to the APA’s “substantial evidence” standard. §7261(a)(4);\nsee Dickinson v. Zurko , 527 U.S.\n150 , 153, 162–163 (1999) (examining the “subtle” difference\nbetween the two standards). Subsection (b) sets forth additional\nrequirements that the Veterans Court must follow “[i]n making the\ndeterminations under subsection (a).” §7261(b). As originally\nenacted, the provision required only that the Veterans Court\n“ ‘take due account of the rule of prejudicial error.’ ”\nVeterans’ Judicial Review Act, §301(a), 102Stat. 4115 (now codified\nat 38 U. S. C. §7261(b)(2)). We have held that this\nstatutory command requires the Veterans Court to apply the same\nkind of harmless-error rule that courts ordinarily apply in civil\ncases. Shinseki v. Sanders , 556\nU.S. 396 , 406 (2009). In 2002, Congress amended subsection (b) to add\nthe provision at issue here. Veterans Benefits Act, §401(b),\n116Stat. 2832. Codified at §7261(b)(1), it directs the Veterans\nCourt to “ ‘take due account of the [VA]’s application of\nsection 5107(b) of this title.’ ” In other words, when\nconducting judicial review under subsection (a), the Veterans Court\nmust “take due account” of the VA’s application of the\nbenefit-of-the-doubt rule. In most cases, an appeal to the Veterans Court\nis a veteran’s final opportunity for judicial review of a benefits\ndecision. Although veterans may appeal certain legal issues to the\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, see §7292,\nthat court has held that it lacks jurisdiction to review most\nfactual determinations, including whether the VA properly applied\nthe benefit-of-the-doubt rule in individual cases, see Ferguson v. Principi , 273 F.3d 1072, 1076 (2001). B Petitioners are veterans who applied for\nservice- connected PTSD disability benefits and were dissatisfied\nwith the VA’s resolution of their claims. 1 Petitioner Joshua Bufkin served in the Air\nForce from late 2005 to early 2006. Although Bufkin intended to\njoin the military police, he never received a job assignment\nbecause he could not pass the required training classes. Bufkin\nblamed his poor performance on marital stress. He reported that his\nwife opposed his service and had threatened to commit suicide if he\nstayed in the military. Bufkin ultimately requested and obtained a\nnonprejudicial hardship discharge. Seven years later, Bufkin sought disability\nbenefits from the VA. He claimed that his military service caused\nseveral psychiatric conditions, including PTSD. To support his PTSD\nclaim, Bufkin submitted a letter from a VA physician who had\nrecently treated him. The physician explained that Bufkin’s wife\nsuffered from depression, and that Bufkin felt forced to make a\nchoice between divorcing his wife or leaving the military. The\nphysician diagnosed Bufkin with PTSD and opined that the primary\nstressor was the perceived threat to his wife’s life. The VA regional office denied Bufkin’s claim on\nthe ground that the medical evidence was insufficient to establish\na link between his symptoms and his military service. Bufkin sought\nreconsideration, and the VA ordered a second examination by a\nsecond VA physician. The new physician determined that Bufkin did\nnot meet the criteria for PTSD. He explained that the first\nphysician was unable to review Bufkin’s military or medical\nrecords, a limitation that may have had a “significant impact” on\nBufkin’s initial diagnosis. App. in No. 2022–1089 (CA Fed.), pp.\n29–30. Bufkin also submitted letters from his wife and mother\ndescribing changes they observed in his personality after his\nmilitary service. The VA regional office reviewed the new\ninformation and reaffirmed its denial of Bufkin’s claim. Bufkin\nfiled a notice of disagreement. He argued that the evidence for and\nagainst his claim was roughly equal and that he was therefore\nentitled to “the benefit of the doubt.” §5107(b). Bufkin then\nunderwent a third VA examination by yet another physician. Like the\nsecond physician, this physician concluded that Bufkin’s symptoms\ndid not meet the criteria for PTSD. She also noted that Bufkin’s\nsymptoms started one year after his discharge, and that no evidence\nindicated that his military service caused a disability. The VA\nregional office again reaffirmed its decision to deny benefits. Bufkin appealed to the Board. While the appeal\nwas pending, he submitted a short statement from a fourth\nphysician. This physician stated that, in his opinion, Bufkin\nsuffered from PTSD, but he noted other doctors might disagree with\nthat diagnosis. He suggested that, at a minimum, Bufkin suffered\nfrom severe anxiety disorder. The Board concluded that Bufkin did not suffer\nfrom PTSD and denied his claim. In a detailed opinion, the Board\nrecounted each physician’s findings and medical conclusions. The\nBoard observed that one physician diagnosed Bufkin with PTSD, two\nphysicians determined he did not have PTSD, and one physician\nthought the issue was debatable. After carefully reviewing each\nmedical opinion, the Board explained that it found the second\nphysician’s report “especially persuasive.” App. to Pet. for Cert.\n61a. The Board noted that the one physician to diagnose Bufkin with\nPTSD had not reviewed his military or medical records. The Board\nalso reviewed the letters from Bufkin’s wife and mother but found\nthat they lacked probative value because neither individual had\nrelevant medical expertise. When taken as a whole, the Board\nexplained, the evidence was not in approximate balance.\nAccordingly, the Board determined that Bufkin was not entitled to\nthe benefit of the doubt. 2 Petitioner Norman Thornton served in the Army\nfrom 1988 to 1991. After being honorably discharged, Thornton\napplied for and received benefits for an “ ‘undiagnosed\nillness.’ ” Id ., at 32a. Years later, he sought\nadditional benefits for service-connected PTSD. The VA granted\nbenefits for the PTSD claim, initially rating his condition as 10%\ndisabling and later increasing the rating to 30%. In 2015, Thornton applied for another increase\nto his PTSD disability rating and underwent a new VA medical\nexamination. The physician concluded that Thornton suffered some\ncommon PTSD symptoms, including depressed mood, anxiety, memory\nloss, and sleep impairment, but questioned whether PTSD was the\ncause of those symptoms. The physician did not find several of the\nmore severe symptoms that earlier medical examinations had\nrevealed, such as suicidal ideation, impaired impulse control, and\npanic attacks. Nevertheless, the regional office increased\nThornton’s PTSD disability rating to 50%. Thornton then sought an\nadditional increase to 70% and underwent another medical\nevaluation, but the regional office maintained the 50% rating. Thornton appealed to the Board, which reviewed\nthe evidence de novo. As in Bufkin’s case, the Board\nthoroughly recounted each medical report and assessed the\ncredibility of each physician’s findings. The Board ultimately\ndeclined to increase Thornton’s 50% disability rating.[ 1 ] 3 Both petitioners appealed the Board’s\nresolution of their PTSD claims to the Veterans Court. They argued\nthat the evidence concerning their diagnoses was in “approximate\nbalance,” so they were entitled to the benefit of the doubt. See\n§5107(b). In both cases, the Veterans Court upheld the Board’s\ndecisions on the ground that the Board’s approximate-balance\ndeterminations were not clearly erroneous. The petitioners then appealed to the Federal\nCircuit, challenging the Veterans Court’s legal interpretation of\n§7261(b)(1). They argued that the statutory command to “take due\naccount” of the VA’s application of the benefit-of-the-doubt rule\nrequires the Veterans Court to review the entire record de\nnovo and decide for itself whether the evidence is in\napproximate balance. The Federal Circuit rejected this argument and\naffirmed the Veterans Court in both cases. 75 F. 4th 1368\n(2023); 2023 WL 5091653 (Aug. 9, 2023). The court held that “the\nstatutory command that the Veterans Court ‘take due account’ of the\nbenefit of the doubt rule does not require the Veterans Court to\nconduct any review of the benefit of the doubt issue beyond the\nclear error review required by” §7261(a). Id. , at *2. We granted certiorari to decide what it means to\n“take due account” of the VA’s application of the\nbenefit-of-the-doubt rule. 601 U. S. ___ (2024). II A We start, as always, with the text. Section\n7261(b)(1) provides that “[i]n making the determinations under\nsubsection (a),” the Veterans Court “shall” “take due account of\nthe [VA]’s application of [the benefit-of-the-doubt rule].” The plain meaning of the text reveals the scope\nof the Veterans Court’s task. It is undisputed that the word\n“shall” imposes a mandatory command. Shapiro v. McManus , 577 U.S.\n39 , 43 (2015). “Shall” means “must.” Kingdomware\nTechnologies, Inc. v. United States , 579 U.S. 162,\n171–172 (2016). It is likewise undisputed that to “take account\nof ” something means to give it attention or consideration.\nSee American Heritage Dictionary 1763 (4th ed. 2000) (defining\n“take account of ” as “[t]o take into consideration”). The\nword “due” qualifies the attention that the VA must give. “Due”\nmeans “appropriate” or “proper.” See 4 Oxford English Dictionary\n1105 (2d ed. 1989) (“Merited, appropriate: proper, right”); Black’s\nLaw Dictionary 515 (7th ed. 1999) (“Just, proper, regular, and\nreasonable”). Taken together, the statutory command to “take\ndue account” of the VA’s application of the benefit-of-the-doubt\nrule requires the Veterans Court to give appropriate attention to\nthe VA’s work, at least when the issue is properly presented. See id ., at 516 (defining “due consideration” as “[t]he degree\nof attention properly paid to something, as the circumstances\nmerit”).[ 2 ] The text makes clear that the appropriate\nattention due is that which is required under subsection (a).\nSection 7261(b)(1) states that the Veterans Court must “take\ndue account” of the VA’s application of the benefit-of-the-doubt\nrule only “[i]n making the determinations under subsection (a).”\nThis language highlights that taking due account is not a\nfreestanding task but rather an aspect of judicial review\nunder subsection (a). The upshot is straightforward. Review of the\nVA’s benefit-of-the-doubt decision is just another determination\nmade “under subsection (a).” §7261(b)(1). Accordingly, the\nstandards of review provided in subsection (a) also govern the\nVeterans Court’s review of benefit-of-the-doubt issues. In\nparticular, subsection (a) requires the Veterans Court to review\nthe VA’s conclusions of law de novo and its findings of\nfact for clear error. See §§7261(a)(1) and (4). Which standard\napplies will depend on whether a veteran raises a legal or factual\nobjection. Section 7261(b)(1) makes explicit the Veterans\nCourt’s previously implicit duty to review the VA’s application of\nthe benefit-of-the-doubt rule, pursuant to the standards set forth\nin subsection (a). Of course, this duty predated Congress’s\nenactment of §7261(b)(1); subsection (a) always required the\nVeterans Court to review all relevant findings of fact and\nconclusions of law. See §§7261(a)(1) and (4). But, Congress’s\nenactment underscores the benefit-of-the-doubt rule’s status as a\nparamount consideration. B The next question, then, is the appropriate\nstandard of review for challenges to the VA’s application of the\nbenefit-of-the-doubt rule. The applicable standard will vary with\nthe challenge, as the application of the rule has both factual and\nlegal components. A veteran may challenge any aspect of the VA’s\napplication of the benefit-of-the-doubt rule on appeal. No one disputes that challenges to the VA’s\nlegal conclusions are subject to de novo review. For\nexample, if the veteran argues that the VA misunderstood the\ndefinition of “approximate balance,” the Veterans Court would\nconstrue the challenge as a legal one and review it de novo . So too if the veteran argues that the VA gave\nthe benefit of the doubt to the wrong party. These arguments, however, are not the typical\narguments a veteran raises on appeal. In mine-run cases, including\nthe two before us, a veteran challenges the VA’s determination that\nthe evidence on a particular material issue is not in approximate\nbalance. Petitioners assert that the approximate-balance\ndetermination is a legal inquiry subject to de novo review. The Government counters that the determination is a factual\nfinding, or at least a mixed question that is predominantly factual\nand reviewed for clear error. After closely examining the way in\nwhich the VA conducts the approximate- balance inquiry, we conclude\nit is a predominantly factual question and thus subject to\nclear-error review. The approximate-balance determination involves\ntwo steps. First, the VA reviews each item of evidence in the\nrecord and assigns weight to it. Both sides agree that this aspect\nof the VA’s analysis is factfinding reviewed only for clear error.\nSecond, the VA assesses the weight of the evidence as a whole,\ndeciding whether “there is an approximate balance of positive and\nnegative evidence” on any material issue. §5107(b). The VA gives\nthe benefit of the doubt to the veteran only after determining that\nthe positive evidence and negative evidence on a material issue are\nin approximate balance. Otherwise, the VA simply resolves the issue\nin favor of the party with the more persuasive evidence. The second step—deciding whether the evidence as\na whole is approximately balanced—has both legal and factual\ncomponents. The task is partly factual because it involves\nmarshaling and weighing evidence. See U. S. Bank\nN. A. v. Village at Lakeridge, LLC , 583 U.S. 387,\n396 (2018). The VA must categorize the evidence based on whether it\nsupports or undermines the veteran’s claim. After doing so, the VA\ncompares the relative strength and persuasiveness of the evidence\non each side. Assigning weight to evidence—whether individual\npieces of evidence or collections of it—is an inherently factual\ntask. See ibid. But, the VA’s decision also involves a legal\ndetermination. After assessing the weight of the assorted evidence,\nthe VA must decide whether the evidence is in “approximate\nbalance.” See §purely legal one.[ 3 ] The appropriate standard of review for a mixed\nquestion depends “on whether answering it entails primarily legal\nor factual work.” U. S. Bank , 583 U. S., at 396.\nSome mixed questions require a court to “expound on the law” by\n“amplifying or elaborating on a broad legal standard.” Ibid. When applying the law involves developing legal principles for use\nin future cases, appellate courts typically review the decision de novo . Ibid. Other mixed questions require courts\nto resolve “case-specific factual issues.” Ibid. When the\ntribunal below is “immerse[d]” in facts and compelled to “marshal\nand weigh evidence” and “make credibility judgments,” the appellate\ncourt “should usually review a decision with deference.” Ibid. Reviewing a determination whether record\nevidence is approximately balanced is “about as factual sounding”\nas any question gets. Id. , at 397. Consider Bufkin’s case.\nTo decide whether Bufkin was entitled to the benefit of the doubt,\nthe Board reviewed four medical opinions and two letters from\nBufkin’s family members. After assigning weight to each item, the\nBoard assessed whether the evidence was roughly equal. To make that\ndetermination, the Board had to consider evidence of Bufkin’s\nsymptoms and their causes, while assessing the credibility of the\nphysicians who treated him. Thornton’s case is no different. The\nBoard assessed the weight of his symptoms, the degree to which they\naffected his day-to-day life, and the credi- bility of each\nphysician. These cases illustrate that the approximate-balance\ndetermination necessarily immerses the Board “in case-specific\nfactual issues.” Id ., at 396. When that is so—that is, when\nthe initial decisionmaker is “marshal[ing] and weigh[ing] evidence”\nand “mak[ing] credibility judgments”—its work is fact intensive,\nand its determinations should be reviewed with deference. Ibid . C Petitioners and the dissent offer various\npaths to a different result. But, their arguments are not\npersuasive. First, petitioners urge us to hold that with one\nmodest phrase, “take due account,” Congress imposed a new standard\nof review for challenges to the VA’s application of the\nbenefit-of-the-doubt rule. Before the Federal Circuit, petitioners\nargued that §7261(b)(1) established a de novo standard of\nreview. They hesitate to call the standard “ de novo review”\nbefore this Court, instead describing it as “APA- plus .”\nBrief for Petitioners 25, 41–42. However labeled, the directive to “take due\naccount” does not do the work that petitioners envision. Had\nCongress intended to impose a new standard of review for challenges\nto the VA’s application of the benefit-of-the-doubt rule, it would\nhave clearly named a standard—just as it did in §7261(a). But, as\nwe have explained, Congress chose not to announce any new standard\nin §7261(b)(1). It instead incorporated the pre-existing standards\nof review set forth in subsection (a). Petitioners contend, in the alternative, that\neven if §7261(b)(1) incorporates the standards of review in\n§7261(a), the VA’s approximate-balance determination is a legal\nquestion subject to de novo review under §7261(a). The\ndissent adopts a similar view, arguing that the approximate-balance\ndetermination is a predominantly legal mixed question. Post ,\nat 12–16 (opinion of Jackson, J.). The de novo standard applies, they say,\nbecause the approximate-balance determination resembles other legal\nor predominantly legal questions that courts review de novo .\nThey point to judicial review of a court’s probable-cause\ndetermination as one such analogue. Post , at 14–15. Probable\ncause is the standard by which a court assesses whether a police\nofficer’s search or seizure was permissible under the Fourth\nAmendment. For example, “probable cause to search . . .\nexist[s] where the known facts and circumstances are sufficient to\nwarrant a man of reasonable prudence in the belief that contraband\nor evidence of a crime will be found.” Ornelas v. United\nStates , 517 U.S.\n690 , 696 (1996). We have held that this inquiry is a mixed\nquestion that courts review de novo . See id. , at\n699. Two features of the probable-cause determination\ndistinguish it from the approximate-balance determination, however,\nand underscore why courts review it de novo . First, because\nprobable cause is a constitutional standard, we start with a strong\npresumption that determinations under that standard are subject to de novo review, even if they require courts to “plung[e]\ninto a factual record.” U. S. Bank , 583 U. S., at\n396, n. 4. Second, probable cause at bottom poses a question that\nrequires substantial “legal work.” Id. , at 398. Because\nprobable cause asks whether the “officer’s understanding of the\nfacts and his understanding of the relevant law” was “reasonable,” Heien v. North Carolina , 574 U.S.\n54 , 61–64 (2014), it requires an objective, legally grounded\ninquiry as to what a hypothetical person could have found, see Kentucky v. King , 563 U.S.\n452 , 464 (2011). The answer to how a hypothetical person would\nact is, by its nature, one that courts refine over time, building\nout principles that “acquire content only through application.” Ornelas , 517 U. S., at 697. De novo review\nis therefore essential so that courts can ensure “unif[orm]\nprecedent” that will “provid[e] law enforcement officers with a\ndefined set of rules which, in most instances, makes it possible to\nreach a correct determination beforehand as to whether an invasion\nof privacy is justified.” Ibid. (internal quotation marks\nomitted). The VA’s approximate-balance determination\ndiffers on both counts. First, the standard is a creature of\nstatute. Because it does not dwell “[i]n the constitutional realm,”\nit is not entitled to the presumption of de novo review that\napplies to probable cause. U. S. Bank , 583 U. S.,\nat 396, n. 4. Second, the approximate-balance inquiry does not\nhave a comparable legal component. Instead, as these cases\nexemplify, that inquiry tends to be case specific and fact\nintensive, with courts evaluating the weight of the evidence for\nand against a particular veteran’s claim. To decide Bufkin’s claim,\nfor example, the VA reviewed a panoply of medical and lay evidence,\nand Bufkin’s central argument before the Veterans Court was that\nthe overall balance of this evidence was closer than the VA\nthought. Thornton’s claim similarly presented case-specific,\nfact-bound issues about the existence and severity of symptoms.\nResolution of these claims is unlikely to generate guidance for the\nVA or future courts in the way that probable-cause precedents do\nfor police and the courts. The VA’s approximate-balance determination is\nlikewise distinct from a court’s conclusion that evidence is\nsufficient to support a criminal conviction, a conclusion that\ncourts review de",

Let me go through each type of bias one by one and see if there's anything in the text that fits.\n\nStarting with Gender Bias. The decision talks about PTSD claims from two male petitioners, Bufkin and Thornton. There doesn't seem to be any mention of gender stereotypes or differential treatment based on gender. The focus is on evidence evaluation, not gender roles.\n\nNext, Religious Bias. I don't see any references to religion in the text. The discussion revolves around legal standards and evidence, so no indication of religious bias here.\n\nRacial Bias: Again, nothing in the decision mentions race or ethnic background. It's all about how the VA evaluates evidence for PTSD claims, so no racial stereotypes or differential treatment based on race are present.\n\nSexual Orientation Bias: There's no mention of sexual orientation at all. The cases involve PTSD related to military service, not anything related to sexual orientation issues.\n\nAge Discrimination: The decision doesn't discuss age limits or any age-related factors affecting the claims. Both petitioners' ages aren't highlighted as a factor in the VA's decisions.\n\nNationality Bias: No national stereotypes or country-specific language is used here. The focus is on individual veterans and their medical evidence, not nationality.\n\nDisability Bias: The text does discuss disabilities (PTSD), but it's about how the VA evaluates the evidence for disability claims. There's no negative stereotyping of people with disabilities; instead, it's a discussion on the legal standards applied.\n\nAppearance Bias: Physical appearance isn't mentioned at all in the decision. The focus is on medical diagnoses and evidence weight, not on how someone looks.\n\nSocioeconomic Status Bias: There's no indication that the veterans' socioeconomic status influenced the VA's decisions. The analysis is based purely on medical evidence and legal standards.\n\nAfter reviewing each category, I don't see any passages that reflect bias as defined in the criteria provided. The decision focuses on legal interpretations and evidentiary standards without targeting any specific group negatively or positively.\n</think>\n\nNo bias",
