Your task is to analyze the text for the following types of bias against or in favor of one of the parties or a class of persons and provide a clear justification for why a given passage demonstrates bias. Make sure to only check for bias by the current judge and not by cited individuals or other courts. \n\nUse the definitions and criteria listed below:\n\n\n1. Gender Bias\nGender bias refers to the systematic unequal treatment of individuals based on gender.\n\nCharacteristics:\n- Structural bias: Use of grammatical constructions that reinforce stereotypical assumptions.\n- Contextual bias: Use of specific words or tone that reinforce gender-related roles or stereotypes.\n\nStereotyping: Attributing traits or occupations based on socially constructed gender roles.\nIdentify gender bias by:\n- Analyzing word associations (e.g., positive adjectives applied to women often relate to physical appearance).\n- Reviewing occupational terms for gender stereotypes.\n- Examining grammatical structures for gender-based generalizations.\n\n\n2. Religious Bias\nReligious bias refers to implicit attitudes and prejudices that often operate below conscious awareness and can hinder interfaith cooperation.\n\nCharacteristics:\n- Rooted in social-psychological differences like status, scriptures, or transnational influences.\n- Group favoritism: the in-group is portrayed positively, the out-group negatively.\n- Divergent adherence to religious texts can amplify perceived theological differences.\n\nIdentify this bias by:\n- Investigating implicit prejudices.\n- Analyzing differing reactions to interfaith messages depending on content and source.\n- Measuring delays in associating positive/negative attributes with specific religious groups.\n\n\n3. Racial Bias\nRacial bias can be either implicit (largely unconscious) or explicit (conscious). Both are widespread and have serious negative effects.\n\nCharacteristics:\n- Reinforced by categorization, stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination.\n- Can result in distorted judgments and discriminatory behavior, even without intent.\n\nIdentify this bias by:\n- Presence of stereotypes in social or professional contexts.\n- Skewed judgments or behaviors under uncertainty or time pressure.\n- Differential treatment based on group characteristics.\n\n\n4. Sexual Orientation Bias\nSexual orientation bias involves the conscious or unconscious disadvantage of individuals based on their sexual preference, especially in the workplace, education, or other social contexts.\n\nCharacteristics:\n- Discrimination based on stereotypes or prejudice against sexual minorities.\n- Unequal treatment in employment, promotion, or other work-related decisions.\n- Denial of equal rights or access to services.\n\nIdentify this bias by:\n- Comparing treatment of homosexual and heterosexual individuals in similar contexts.\n- Analyzing language or actions that reflect explicit or implicit prejudice.\n- Detecting disproportionate application of rules that disadvantage certain groups.\n\n\n5. Age Discrimination\nAge discrimination refers to unequal treatment or disadvantage based on age, unless justified by legitimate social policy or objective reasons. This includes both direct and indirect discrimination.\n\nCharacteristics:\n- Defined age limits in policy settings without objective justification.\n- Relevance of proportionality checks when applying different age thresholds.\n\nIdentify this bias by:\n- Disadvantaging groups due to rigid age limits unrelated to policy goals.\n- Age thresholds that restrict access to public benefits.\n- Examples such as unemployment insurance limited to certain age groups.\n\n\n6. Nationality Bias\nNationality bias involves the systematic distortion of how countries or their citizens are portrayed, often through stereotypes or demeaning depictions.\n\nCharacteristics:\n- Stereotypical or derogatory language about certain nationalities.\n- Overemphasis on military conflict or political instability in particular countries.\n\nIdentify this bias by:\n- Focus on topics like violence, terrorism, or corruption disproportionately in relation to specific countries.\n\n\n7. Disability Bias\nBias against people with disabilities refers to automatically triggered, unconscious attitudes that result in negative perceptions or treatment. These are often based on societal stereotypes.\n\nCharacteristics:\n- Implicit negative preferences for non-disabled individuals.\n- Automatic associations of disability with negative concepts (e.g., \"bad,\" \"incompetent\").\n- Tendency to view people with disabilities as childlike or less capable.\n\nIdentify this bias by:\n- Analyzing associations between \"disability\" and negative terms.\n- Identifying subtle language implying lack of competence or autonomy.\n- Uncovering implicit assumptions in decisions that disadvantage disabled individuals.\n\n\n8. Appearance Bias\nPhysical attractiveness is often used as a heuristic for desirable traits. Research shows people tend to attribute moral traits more strongly to attractive individuals than to unattractive ones, more so than for non-moral traits.\n\nCharacteristics:\n- Attractive people are more likely to be seen as moral.\n- Moral traits are more strongly associated with appearance than non-moral traits.\n- These perceptions are shaped by quick heuristic judgments.\n\nIdentify this bias by:\n- Checking whether traits like honesty or trustworthiness are linked to physical attractiveness.\n- Analyzing whether social desirability is disproportionately projected onto attractive people.\n- Comparing attribution patterns for moral vs. non-moral traits across different appearances.\n\n\n9. Socioeconomic Status Bias\nBias based on socioeconomic status involves the systematic disadvantage or differential treatment of individuals due to their economic or social position, often affecting equal opportunity.\n\nCharacteristics:\n- Unequal access to education and job opportunities.\n- Different treatment or perceptions based on income or wealth.\n- Influence of subjective status perceptions on decisions.\n\nIdentify this bias by:\n- Analyzing disparities in education, income, or political participation across groups.\n- Identifying unequal outcomes despite comparable ability or resources.\n- Observing social mobility barriers and structural inequality.\n\n\nHere is the court decision:\n{text}\n\nEND OF DECISION TEXT\n\nOutput Format:\nIf none of the above biases are found in the judgment, respond only with:\n“No bias” (without explanation).\n\nIf one or more types of bias are found, respond for each one using this format in continuous prose (no bullet points):\n\nIdentified Bias: [Insert the type of bias, e.g., \"Gender Bias\", \"Religious Bias\", etc.]  \nText Passage: \"[Insert the relevant quoted passage from the court decision]\"  \nJustification: [Explain why this passage reflects the identified bias]\n\nRepeat this format for each identified bias.",
    "full_text": " PER CURIAM BRADSHAW V. RICHEY 546 U. S. ____ (2005) SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES MARGARET BRADSHAW, WARDEN v. KENNETH T.\nRICHEY on petition for writ of certiorari to the united\nstates court of appeals for the sixth circuit No. 05–101. Decided November 28, 2005 Per Curiam. In 1987, respondent Kenneth T.\nRichey was tried in Ohio for aggravated murder committed in the\ncourse of a felony. Evidence showed that respondent set fire to the\napartment of his neighbor, Hope Collins, in an attempt to kill his\nex-girlfriend and her new boyfriend, who were spending the night\ntogether in the apartment below. The intended victims escaped\nunharmed, but Hope Collins’ 2-year-old daughter Cynthia died in the\nfire. At trial, the State presented evidence of respondent’s intent\nto kill his ex-girlfriend and her boyfriend, but not of specific\nintent to kill Cynthia Collins. The State also offered expert\nforensic evidence to show that the fire had been started\ndeliberately. Respondent did not contest this forensic evidence at\ntrial because his retained arson expert had reported that the\nState’s evidence conclusively established arson. Respondent was\nconvicted of aggravated felony murder on a theory of transferred\nintent and sentenced to death. His conviction and sentence were\naffirmed on direct appeal, where he was represented by new\ncounsel. Respondent sought postconviction relief in\nstate court. The state trial court denied his request for an\nevidentiary hearing and denied relief on all claims, and the state\nappellate court affirmed. Respondent then sought federal habeas\nrelief. The District Court permitted discovery on certain issues,\nbut ultimately denied all of respondent’s claims. The Sixth Circuit\nreversed, holding that respondent was entitled to habeas relief on\ntwo alternative grounds. First, that transferred intent was not a\npermissible theory for aggravated felony murder under Ohio law, and\nthat the evidence of direct intent was constitutionally\ninsufficient to support conviction. Second, that the performance of\nrespondent’s trial counsel had been constitutionally deficient\nunder Strickland v. Washington , 466 U. S. 668 (1984), in\nhis retaining and mishandling of his arson expert and in his\ninadequate treatment of the State’s expert testimony. We now grant the State’s petition for writ of\ncertiorari and vacate the judgment below. I The Sixth Circuit erred in\nholding that the doctrine of transferred intent was inapplicable to\naggravated felony murder for the version of Ohio Rev. Code Ann.\n§2903.01(B) (Anderson 1982) under which respondent was convicted.\nSee Richey v. Mitchell, 395 F. 3d 660, 675\n(2005). The Ohio Supreme Court’s interpretation of that section, as\nannounced in its review of respondent’s case, directly contradicts\nthe Sixth Circuit’s analysis: “The fact that the intended victims escaped harm,\nand that an innocent child, Cynthia Collins, was killed instead,\ndoes not alter Richey’s legal and moral responsibility. ‘The\ndoctrine of transferred intent is firmly rooted in Ohio law.’ Very\nsimply, ‘the culpability of a scheme designed to implement the\ncalculated decision to kill is not altered by the fact that the\nscheme is directed at someone other than the actual victim.’ ” State v. Richey , 64 Ohio St. 3d 353, 364,\n595 N. E. 2d 915, 925 (1992) (citations omitted). This statement was dictum, since the only\nsufficiency-of-evidence claim raised by respondent pertained to his\nsetting of the fire. Nonetheless, its explanation of Ohio law was\nperfectly clear and unambiguous. We have repeatedly held that a\nstate court’s interpretation of state law, including one announced\non direct appeal of the challenged conviction, binds a federal\ncourt sitting in habeas corpus. Estelle v. McGuire , 502\nU. S. 62 , 67–68 (1991); Mullaney v. Wilbur , 421 U. S. 684 ,\n691 (1975). The Sixth Circuit held that the Ohio Supreme\nCourt’s opinion should not be read to endorse transferred intent in\nrespondent’s case because such a construction would likely\nconstitute “an unforeseeable and retroactive judicial expansion of\nnarrow and precise statutory language,” Bouie v. City\nof Columbia , 378 U. S. 347 , 352\n(1964), in violation of the Due Process Clause. 395 F. 3d, at\n677 (citing United States v. Lanier , 520 U. S. 259 (1997); Bouie , 378 U. S., at 352). It is doubtful whether this\nprinciple of fair notice has any application to a case of\ntransferred intent, where the defendant’s contemplated conduct was exactly what the relevant statute forbade, see id ., at 351. And it is further doubtful whether the\ndoctrine of constitutional doubt permits such a flatly\ncountertextual interpretation of what the Ohio Supreme Court said,\nsee Salinas v. United States , 522 U. S. 52 , 59–60\n(1997). But assuming all that, Ohio law at the time of respondent’s\noffense provided fully adequate notice of the applicability of\ntransferred intent. The relevant mens rea provision in\n§2903.01(D) required only that “[n]o person shall be convicted of\naggravated murder unless he is specifically found to have intended\nto cause the death of another .” Ohio Rev. Code Ann.\n§2903.01(D) (Anderson 1982) (emphasis added). Respondent’s\nintention to kill his ex-girlfriend and her boyfriend plainly came\nwithin this provision. There was no reason to read “another”\n(countertextually) as meaning only “the actual victim,” since the\ndoctrine of transferred intent was “firmly rooted in Ohio law.” State v. Sowell , 39 Ohio St. 3d 322, 332,\n530 N. E. 2d 1294, 1305 (1988) (citing Wareham v. State , 25 Ohio St. 601 (1874)). Respondent could not\nplausibly claim unfair surprise that the doctrine applied in his\ncase. See Lanier , supra , at 269–270 (requiring,\nas adequate notice for due process purposes, only “reasonable\nwarning,” rather than fundamentally similar prior cases). The foregoing provision was in effect at the\ntime of respondent’s crime in 1986. The Sixth Circuit reasoned,\nhowever, that the following subsequent clause in the version of\n§2903.01(D) that existed in 1986 foreclosed transferred intent in\nthis case: “If a jury in an aggravated murder case is\ninstructed that a person who commits or attempts to commit any\noffense listed in division (B) of this section may be\ninferred , because he engaged in a common design with others to\ncommit the offense by force or violence or because the offense and\nthe manner of its commission would be likely to produce death, to have intended to cause the death of any person who is\nkilled during the commission of … the offense, the jury also\nshall be instructed that … it is to consider all evidence\nintroduced by the prosecution to indicate the person’s intent and\nby the person to indicate his lack of intent in determining whether the person specifically intended to cause the death of\nthe person killed … .” Ohio Rev. Code Ann.\n§2903.01(D) (Anderson 1982) (emphases added). Contrary to the Sixth Circuit’s reading, see 395\nF. 3d, at 673, this clause by its terms did not apply to every\ncase in which the defendant was charged with aggravated felony\nmurder, but rather only to those in which intent to kill was sought\nto be proved from the inherent dangerousness of the relevant\nfelony. See State v. Phillips , 74 Ohio St. 3d 72,\n100, 656 N. E. 2d 643, 668 (1995) (“R. C. §2903.01(D)\ndoes not apply in this case because the trial court never\ninstructed that the jury could infer purpose to kill from the\ncommission of an underlying felony ‘in a manner likely to produce\ndeath’ ”). Here, however, intent to kill was proved directly.\nIt was not inferred from the dangerousness of the arson; it was\nshown to be the purpose of the arson. The Sixth Circuit also argued that dicta in a\ncase decided by an intermediate Ohio appellate court, prior to the\nOhio Supreme Court’s opinion here, rejected transferred intent for\nrespondent’s crime, and thus rendered its application in\nrespondent’s case unforeseeable and retroactive. 395 F. 3d, at\n675–676 (citing State v. Mullins , 76 Ohio\nApp. 3d 633, 602 N. E. 2d 769 (1992)). But that case was\ndecided long after the 1986 offense for which respondent was\nconvicted, and thus has no bearing on whether the law at the time\nof the charged conduct was clear enough to provide fair\nnotice. Lanier , supra; see also Marks v. United States , 430 U. S. 188 , 196\n(1977). Because the Sixth Circuit disregarded the Ohio\nSupreme Court’s authoritative interpretation of Ohio law, its\nruling on sufficiency of the evidence was erroneous. II The Sixth Circuit also held that\nrespondent was entitled to relief on the ground that the state\ncourts’ denial of his Strickland claim was unreasonable.\n395 F. 3d, at 688. As petitioner contends, the Sixth Circuit\nerred in its adjudication of this claim by relying on evidence that\nwas not properly presented to the state habeas courts without first\ndetermining (1) whether respondent was at fault for failing to\ndevelop the factual bases for his claims in state court, see Williams v. Taylor , 529 U. S. 420 , 430–432\n(2000), or (2) whether respondent satisfied the criteria\nestablished by 28 U. S. C. §2254(e)(2). See Holland v. Jackson , 452 U. S. 649 , (2004) (per curiam) . Similarly, the Sixth Circuit erred by\ndisregarding the state habeas courts’ conclusion that the forensic\nexpert whom respondent’s trial counsel hired was a “properly\nqualified expert,” App. to Pet. for Cert. 347a, without analyzing\nwhether the state court’s factual finding had been rebutted by\nclear and convincing evidence. See 28 U. S. C. §2254(e)(1).\nCompare App. to Pet. for Cert., 347a, with 395 F. 3d, at 683.\nIn addition, as petitioner contends, the Sixth Circuit erred in\nrelying on certain grounds that were apparent from the trial record\nbut not raised on direct appeal—namely that trial counsel (1)\ninadequately cross-examined experts called by the State, (2) erred\nby prematurely placing the forensic expert counsel had hired on the\nwitness list, and (3) failed to present competing scientific\nevidence against the State’s forensic experts—without first\ndetermining whether respondent’s procedural default of these\nsubclaims could be excused by a showing of cause and prejudice or\nby the need to avoid a miscarriage of justice. See App. to Pet. for\nCert. 340a–341a, 351a–354a (state courts’ holding that these\nsubclaims should have been raised on direct appeal); id., at 109a–110a (District Court’s holding that this default was not\nexcusable under Coleman v. Thompson , 501 U. S. 722 , 749–750\n(1991)). Respondent, however, contends that the State failed to\npreserve its objection to the Sixth Circuit’s reliance on evidence\nnot presented in state court by failing to raise this argument\nproperly before the Sixth Circuit. See Brief in Opposition 24–26.\nBecause the relevant errors had not yet occurred, the Sixth Circuit\nhas had no opportunity to address the argument that the State\nfailed to preserve its Holland argument. It is better\nsituated to address this argument in the first instance. *  *  * For the foregoing reasons, the\njudgment of the Sixth Circuit is vacated, and the case is remanded\nfor further proceedings consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered.",

            "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this court decision for any biases as per the given definitions. Let me go through it step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the entire text carefully to understand the context and the arguments presented. The case is about Kenneth Richey being convicted of aggravated murder due to a fire he set, which resulted in the death of Cynthia Collins, a 2-year-old girl. The main issues are around transferred intent and ineffective assistance of counsel.\n\nNow, I'll check each type of bias one by one.\n\n1. **Gender Bias**: Looking for any language that reinforces gender stereotypes or treats genders unequally. The text mentions Richey's ex-girlfriend and her new boyfriend but doesn't make any stereotypical assumptions based on gender. It focuses on the legal arguments without gendered language.\n\n2. **Religious Bias**: There's no mention of religion in the decision, so this isn't applicable.\n\n3. **Racial Bias**: The text doesn't refer to race at all, so no racial bias here either.\n\n4. **Sexual Orientation Bias**: Again, nothing about sexual orientation is discussed, so this isn't a factor.\n\n5. **Age Discrimination**: Cynthia was 2 years old, but the decision doesn't treat age as a basis for discrimination. It's just stating facts about her death.\n\n6. **Nationality Bias**: No nationalities are mentioned or stereotyped in the text.\n\n7. **Disability Bias**: There's no reference to disabilities, so this isn't relevant.\n\n8. **Appearance Bias**: The decision doesn't discuss anyone's appearance, so no bias here.\n\n9. **Socioeconomic Status Bias**: The case doesn't touch on socioeconomic factors; it's focused on legal interpretations and evidence.\n\nAfter reviewing each category, I don't see any passages that reflect the biases listed. The court's analysis is centered on legal principles without any biased language or treatment towards any group.\n</think>\n\nNo bias",
